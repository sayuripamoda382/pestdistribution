This study was carried out as an observational field survey during the "Maha" season of 2024. 
From each district, rice plant samples (n = 30 per field) were collected. The severity of nematode 
infestation was assessed by counting the number of galls on each plant. Along with this, important 
contextual information was recorded at the time of sampling, including plant age, topography of 
the field, irrigation method, soil type, and rice variety. 
Geospatial data tools, particularly the ArcGIS mapping platform, were employed to retrieve site
specific data such as agro-ecological region, dominant soil type, and terrain characteristics, based 
on GPS coordinates of each sampled location. These mapped layers support the spatial analysis of 
nematode distribution and help in identifying regional risk patterns.
